### Description
Messenger Launcher is intended to be an efficient, lightweight add-on for those who use the Facebook Messenger browser site often. It speeds up workflow by removing the need to interact with the Messenger page's UI as often, instead allowing users to simply type in the Omnibox (address bar) to open a specific chat.

This extension runs purely by listening to and acting upon Chrome tabs.
